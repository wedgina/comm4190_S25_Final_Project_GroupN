As it continues to gain much more traction, artificial intelligence continues to bring many concerns about its effects on academia, with many fearing it will ultimately disrupt academic interaction. There's been a rapid and recent development in student use of artificial intelligence in with their classwork, helping them to write essays, cheat on exams, and do homework. However, AI can continue to be used in other and rather more positive conditions, such as helping to study for an exam, understand a difficult concept, and just overall minimizing just mundane tasks that can be associated with coursework. This is especially helpful considering there are a good amount of students who suffer from inadequate help or thin amount of resources in the classroom.  

AIvy would minimize the gap between students struggling to get material from class and the not so uncommon lack of accessibility to resources within the classroom. And when students typically use AI to assist them with their learning, it is often convoluted and doesn't initiall explain things in the most easy ways. My study copilot comes with 4 modes to tailor the use to more specific and direct needs, one is a Test mode, that would generate tests with the amount of questions preferred by the user. Often times, especially in STEM courses, professors don't provide ample practice problems to really help the student solidify and practice their understanding of the concept at hand. This mode can also be use to test the student's understanding of the concept overall. The following mode is a tutor mode, which can be used for when students have concepts they are stuck trying to grasp. The Initial Learning mode can be used not when the student is struggling to understnad something but mostly for when they are initially learning or wanting to learn something and just want that initial practice to introduce them to that concept, such as going over and studying something from lecture. And the last, which is called the concept mapper mode, helps the students to create a concept map consisting of detailed, yet concise notes that will help enforce topics but also help to connect its significance and implications back to the overall concept. 

Welcome to my study copilot created to assist students specifically with helping them learn and practice new topics to them. Hopefully you are able to better comprehend, encode, and practice topics that weren't so easy to learn the first time.
